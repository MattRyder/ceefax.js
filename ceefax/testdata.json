        "article": "Plans to scrap GCSEs in key subjects in England and replace them with English Baccalaureate Certificates are being abandoned by the government.\n\nThe reversal was announced by the education secretary in the Commons, alongside curriculum changes.\n\nMichael Gove said plans for the new exams had been \"a bridge too far\".\n\nHe had wanted to bring in what he said were more rigorous exams in some core subjects from 2015, but faced criticism from MPs and teachers.\n\nLabour's shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg told MPs the announcement was a \"humiliating climb-down\" and exam policy a \"total shambles\".\n\nThe change means plans for the new qualification, announced in September, are being shelved, while GCSEs are retained, despite having been previously condemned by the education secretary."

        "article": "Chris Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce has told a court she had \"no choice\" but to take his speeding points in 2003.\nMs Pryce, 60, said when Huhne asked her to take the points she gave a \"resounding no\" but weeks later she received a letter addressed to her as the \"nominated driver\" and \"exploded\".\nShe told Southwark Crown Court he told her: \"You've got to sign this now.\"\nMs Pryce denies perverting the course of justice. Huhne admitted the charge on Monday and has resigned as an MP.\nFormer Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Huhne and Ms Pryce, an economist, were charged over an incident in March 2003 when his car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 motorway between Stansted Airport in Essex and London.\nIt is alleged that between 12 March and 21 May 2003, Ms Pryce falsely informed police that she was the driver of the car so Huhne could avoid prosecution."

        "article": "Exploits in the bestselling video game Dead Space 3 are allowing users to obtain in-game items for free.\nThe \"cheats\" could prove costly to the title's publisher, Electronic Arts (EA), which has introduced a system that charges users cash for extra equipment in the sequel.\nThe move has proved controversial with some, since the title already costs about £40.\nEA has the ability to issue an update to remove the workarounds.\nHowever, a spokesman said the firm had no comment on the issue.\nDead Space 3 is an action-horror third-person shooter set on a frozen planet.\nPart of its challenge is locating scarce in-game resources needed to create ammunition and medical packs in order to tackle the title's monsters.\nIn previous games in the franchise, the user needed to find credits in order to buy upgrades. However, the new game introduces real-money micro-transactions as a way of allowing players to add equipment faster than would otherwise be possible."

        "article": "For the first time since the 1960s, there are more people in England renting from private landlords than from councils or housing associations.\nThe English Housing Survey for 2011-12 shows that the rising number of private tenants, 3.84 million, outnumbered the 3.8 million in social housing.\nThe trend partly reflects the boom in buy-to-let ownership.\nIt also reflects increasing demand for rented homes from a rising population and those locked out of home ownership.\nCampbell Robb, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: \"This historic shift in our housing market is bad news for anyone struggling to find a decent and affordable home.\n\"With the security of home ownership or social renting harder to find than ever, more and more families have no choice but to live with the insecurity and expense of private renting.\n\"As saving for a home of their own becomes increasingly out of reach, many have no choice but to live in rented homes for years on end,\" he added."

        "article": "Sir Alec Guinness's personal letters and diaries will be available to the public for the first time next year.\nThe British Library has acquired the personal archive of the Oscar-winning actor, best known for his roles in Star Wars and the Ealing comedies.\nThe archive includes more than 100 volumes of diaries and letters recording his career as an actor from the late 1930s to his death in 2000.\nIt also charts his wartime experiences and the death of Sir Laurence Olivier.\nWriting in his diary on 12 July 1989, the day after Sir Laurence's death, he wrote:\n\"His 'I defy you, stars' in Romeo was memorable. And so was his Poor naked wretches etc in Lear. But his famous howl in Oedipus I thought just tiresome.\n\"He knew every trick of the trade and used every one, including, when he made his first entrance the lights coming up a few points and going down again when he left.\n\"He was always very conscious of the audience - and his own powers over them. I'm not sure he was an artist but he was total actor - a giant among actors.\""
